### Module 3 Challenge: Election Analysis

For this challenge, I continued the work in the module to add analysis of the county voter breakdown and the count with the largest turnout. This process involved adding several chunks of code, most of which could be repurposed from code chunks already used in the analysis tool.

First, I initialized several variables, lists, and dictionaries to store the county voter data.

Next, I created a for loop with nested if statements to track vote totals by county.

Last, I determined the county with the largest turnout and added the results to the output file; the produced file is an exact replica of the text example from the module challenge instructions.
